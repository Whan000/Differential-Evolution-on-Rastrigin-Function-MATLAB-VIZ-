## Overview

The script implements the classic **DE/rand/1/bin** variant of Differential Evolution to minimize the **Rastrigin** function. The Rastrigin function is intentionally chosen because:

- it is **multimodal** (many local minima),
- it is **bounded** (commonly \[-5.12, 5.12\]),
- and it is **standard in optimization literature**, which makes it easy to compare.

To make the optimization process *visible*, the script displays **four synchronized plots**:

1. a 3D surface of the Rastrigin function,
2. a 2D contour (top view) with population movement,
3. a convergence curve,
4. a parameter/status panel (live refreshed).

This makes it ideal for teaching **population-based search**, showing **exploration ‚Üí exploitation**, and demonstrating **early stopping**.

---

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ Pure MATLAB, single-file script
- ‚úÖ Differential Evolution (mutation, crossover, selection)
- ‚úÖ Early stopping based on **fitnessThreshold**
- ‚úÖ **4-panel live visualization** using `tiledlayout`
- ‚úÖ Population dots update every generation
- ‚úÖ Text-based status showing best solution so far
- ‚úÖ Designed for **D = 2** problems so that visualization is meaningful
- ‚úÖ Easy to extend to other benchmark functions

---

## Prerequisites

- **MATLAB**: R2018b or later is recommended (earlier versions may still work if they support `tiledlayout`)
- No additional toolboxes required
- A machine capable of redrawing ~1000 points per iteration

---

## How to Run

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Save the MATLAB script (for example as `de_rastrigin.m`).
3. Open the script in MATLAB.
4. Run:

   ```matlab
   de_rastrigin


or simply press **Run** in the MATLAB editor.

5. A figure window will open with 4 subplots that update every generation.

> **Note:** if the animation is too slow, reduce `NP`, reduce `GenMax`, or decrease `pause(0.05)` in the main loop.

---

## File Structure

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          ‚Üê this file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ de_rastrigin.m     ‚Üê main MATLAB script (the code you provided)
```

You can rename the script to anything (e.g. `main.m`, `demo_de.m`), but keep the Rastrigin function in the same file or on the MATLAB path.

---

## Parameter Guide

All parameters are declared at the top of the script:

```matlab
D = 2;                        % Problem dimension
NP = 1000;                    % Population size
F = 0.8;                      % Mutation factor
CR = 0.9;                     % Crossover rate
GenMax = 1000;                % Maximum generations
bounds = [-5.12, 5.12];       % Variable bounds
fitnessThreshold = 0.000001;  % Stop if best fitness < this value
```

### Core Parameters

| Parameter          | Description                                                       | Typical Values / Notes                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `D`                | Number of dimensions of the optimization problem                  | `2` for visualization. You can set `3+`, but only first 2 dims are plotted |
| `NP`               | Population size (number of candidate solutions)                   | 10‚Äì100√óD. Here `1000` is large to make movement visible                    |
| `F`                | Mutation factor (also called differential weight)                 | `0.4 ‚Äì 1.0`. Higher ‚Üí larger jumps                                         |
| `CR`               | Crossover rate (probability to inherit from mutant)               | `0.7 ‚Äì 1.0` is common                                                      |
| `GenMax`           | Maximum number of generations to run                              | Acts as a hard stop                                                        |
| `bounds`           | Lower and upper bounds for every variable                         | For Rastrigin, `[-5.12, 5.12]` is standard                                 |
| `fitnessThreshold` | If best fitness drops below this value, the algorithm stops early | Use `1e-6` or `1e-8` depending on precision requirement                    |

### Effect of Parameters

* **Increase `NP`** ‚Üí better coverage, more accurate solution, but slower.
* **Increase `F`** ‚Üí more exploration but may overshoot.
* **Decrease `CR`** ‚Üí offspring resemble parent more (more exploitation).
* **Tighten `fitnessThreshold`** ‚Üí algorithm tries longer to get closer to global minimum.
* **Increase `GenMax`** ‚Üí allows more evolution, but may not be needed if early stopping works.

## What the Script Does

The main loop:

1. **For each individual `i`** in the population:

   * Randomly pick **3 distinct** individuals: `x1`, `x2`, `x3`
   * **Mutation:**
     [
     v = x_1 + F \cdot (x_2 - x_3)
     ]
     Then clip `v` to bounds.
   * **Binomial crossover:** create trial vector `u` by mixing current individual and mutant vector.
   * **Selection:** if `f(u) <= f(x_i)` then `u` replaces `x_i`.
2. **After each generation**:

   * find best fitness & best solution
   * update all 4 plots
   * save best fitness to `fitnessHistory(gen)`
   * check **early stopping**:

     ```matlab
     if bestVal < fitnessThreshold
         break;
     end
     ```
3. **At the end**: print best solution and reason for stopping.

This flow is consistent with the **canonical DE algorithm** as proposed by Storn and Price (1997) and later described in standard evolutionary computation textbooks.

## Visualization Layout

The script uses:

```matlab
figure('Position',[100 100 1600 800]);
tiledlayout(2,2,'Padding','compact','TileSpacing','compact');
```

and then:

1. **Plot 1 (top-left):** 3D surface of Rastrigin

   * `surf(...)`
   * population plotted with `plot3(...)`
   * best individual in **red**
2. **Plot 2 (top-right):** 2D contour, square aspect

   * `contourf(...)`
   * enforced:

     ```matlab
     axis(ax2, 'equal');
     axis(ax2, 'square');
     ```
   * shows population spreading and clustering
3. **Plot 3 (bottom-left):** convergence curve

   * x-axis: generation
   * y-axis: best fitness
4. **Plot 4 (bottom-right):** parameter & status panel

   * shown using `text(...)`
   * displays current generation, best fitness, best solution, convergence status

This setup is especially useful for **screen recording**, **YouTube tutorials**, and **live lectures**, where students can *see* the optimization progress.

## Changing the Objective Function

The Rastrigin function is defined at the end:

```matlab
function f = rastrigin(X)
    A = 10;
    f = A * size(X, 2) + sum(X.^2 - A * cos(2 * pi * X), 2);
end
```

To optimize **your own** function:

1. Define a new function, e.g.:

   ```matlab
   function f = myfun(X)
       % X is N x D
       f = sum(X.^2, 2);  % example: sphere
   end
   ```

2. Replace **every** call to `rastrigin(...)` with `myfun(...)`:

   ```matlab
   fitness = myfun(pop);
   ...
   zgrid = myfun([xgrid(:), ygrid(:)]);
   ```

3. Adjust `bounds` to your function domain.

> **Important:** the script assumes that the function can evaluate **many points at once** (vectorized call). Keep that behavior for speed.

## Typical Output

You will see prints like:

```text
Generation 1: Best Fitness = 43.219381
Generation 10: Best Fitness = 12.004826
Generation 20: Best Fitness = 0.948201
*** CONVERGENCE ACHIEVED ***
Generation 37: Best Fitness = 0.000001 (below threshold 0.000001)
----------------------------------------
STOPPED: Fitness threshold reached at generation 37
Best Solution Found: [0.0000, -0.0000]
Function Value: 0.000001
```

* If you **do not** reach the threshold, it will say:

  ```text
  COMPLETED: Maximum generations reached
  ```

* The figure will stop updating after exit.

## FAQ

**Q1. Can I increase the dimension `D` to 10 or 30?**
Yes. DE will still work. However, only the **first two dimensions** are visualized in plots 1 and 2 because we cannot draw high-dimensional spaces nicely. For higher dimensions, rely on the **convergence curve** and console output.

**Q2. MATLAB is slow with `NP = 1000`. What should I do?**
Reduce:

* `NP` to 200‚Äì300
* or `GenMax`
* or remove / slow down plotting (`drawnow` ‚Üí comment it)
  This repo is intentionally **visual-first**, so performance can be traded for clarity.

**Q3. Can I use another benchmark (Sphere, Ackley, Rosenbrock)?**
Yes. Just replace the objective function and adjust `bounds`. Keep the vectorized input-output format.

**Q4. Why Rastrigin?**
Because it has many local minima and a known global minimum at **x = 0** with **f(0) = 0**, which makes it very convenient to check whether DE is working.
